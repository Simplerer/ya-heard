  ## Description
 An application that provides a share space for recommendations for a few key cities. As popularity grows we plan to add more locations as we recieve enough requests. This space is meant to be a sharing space for local-only businesses and the admins will be removing spam and non-compatible recommendations. To sort out the recommendations, we have divided all into four seperate and distinct categories. The categories we chose are broad enough to avoid an overwhelming amount of choices, and yet narrow enough to all be relatable.
    
  ## Usage
  
  To use this application, one needs to just navigate the home site <enter site here> and peruse away. When landing on the home page you will be presented with choices cities currently available. Select one and then find which of categories suits your needs; Arts and Entertainment, Food and Beverage, Shopping and Retail, and Services. Once you select an option you will be taken to a display of all current recommendations. You may peruse through untill your hearts content and if you feel inspired, just sign up and you can share your own local tips.
