LOADING RECOMMENDATIONS

- line 29 home-routes.js
- needs to loop through category before rendering
   - or search category and loop through locations
- currently this grabs all recommends for location, need a way to search through and grab specifically location, categories to show
- maybe we can have 4 identical gets, path as follows
   /recommendations/A&E/:id
   /recommendations/F&B/:id
   /recommendations/Retail/:id
   /recommendations/services/:id

   -id being location id
